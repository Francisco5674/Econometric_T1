## Files and data

The whole homework has different main files that run each part of the tasks explained in the next chart

| File                        | Question                                    |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| "P1a.m"                     | Question 1 letter a) (programmed in matlab) |
| "P1 inconditional logit.do" | Question 1 from letter b) to d)             |
| "P1 conditional logit.do"   | Question 1 from letter e) to f)             |
| "P2.do"                     | Question 2                                  |
| "P3.do"                     | Question 3                                  |

* All those files will run as long as they are in the same directory than the rest of the .csv and .dta files they use as data. (Only "P1a.m" has a directory set command, the stata files have to be setted before run)
